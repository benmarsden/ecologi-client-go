## Testing and QA

### Makefile

For testing convenience, `Makefile` provides some nice testing targets you can use. For example:

- `make test` runs all repository tests, and is a quick and easy way to verify you have not broken anything. 
- `make display-coverage` runs all repo tests and then loads an interactive coverage viewer.  
### pre-commit

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) has been set up in the repository. Use this to keep your commits clean.

### CI 

CI runs (that test and build the client library) take place on every commit and pull request to the repository. This must pass before any PR is considered valid for merge.

To test the outcome of CI locally, you can use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act). The Makefile target `make act` has been set up to support this.
